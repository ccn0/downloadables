# WordGen

WordGen is a funny little software that generates a word. It doesn't *pick* a word, it *creates* a word.

## Controls

Plus to add a word, Trash to delete the current word, Export to export the list, and Music for some music.
Right-click Plus to play random words, Right-click Trash to delete all words so far.

## How it works

When you click to generate, a random amount of letters in combined, they could be vowels, consonants, or hyphens. Then, it randomly draws a noun and/or a verb and
combines them with the word, creating a word that looks a bit like `aia: to deforest` or maybe something a bit more incoherent like `wwnwgdqnioa: to whimper`. These
examples are cherry-picked, so you might not get something good all the time. If you want good words, just trash the ones you don't want/like. We won't judge.
